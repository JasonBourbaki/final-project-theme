*Lorem ipsum is boring, how about some actually good Roman content?*

## Scene II, Act III, *Julius Caesar* by William Shakespeare (this is a h2 element)

### Mark Anthony (this is h3):

**Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;**
I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
The evil that men do lives after them;
The good is oft interred with their bones;
So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus
Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:
If it were so, it was a grievous fault,
And grievously hath Caesar answer’d it.

#### Oh boy here the spicy part begins (this is h4)

Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest–
For Brutus is an honourable man;
So are they all, all honourable men–
Come I to speak in Caesar’s funeral.
He was my friend, faithful and just to me:
But Brutus says he was ambitious;
And Brutus is an honourable man.

##### How about we quote the text for real? (this is h5)

> He hath brought many captives home to Rome
>
> Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:
>
> Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?
>
> When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:
>
> Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:
>
> Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
>
> And Brutus is an honourable man.

###### How about we turn poetry into code? (this is h6)

    You all did see that on the Lupercal
    I thrice presented him a kingly crown,
    Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?
    Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
    And, sure, he is an honourable man.

#### Let's try out unordered lists

- I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,
- But here I am to speak what I do know.
- You all did love him once, not without cause:
- What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?

#### How about line numbers?

1. O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,
2. And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;
3. My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,
4. And I must pause till it come back to me.
